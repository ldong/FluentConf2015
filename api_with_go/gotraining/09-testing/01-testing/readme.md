## Testing and Benchmarking

Testing is built right into the go tools and the standard library. Testing needs to be a vital part of the development process because it can save you a tremendous amount of time throughout the life cycle of the project. Benchmarking is also a very powerful tool tied to the testing functionality. Aspect of your code can be setup to be benchmarked for performance reviews. Profiling provides a view of the interations between functions and which functions are most heavlily used.

## Notes

* The Go toolset has support for testing and benchmarking.
* The tools are very flexible and give you many options.
* Write tests in tandem with development.
* "Example" tests serve as both a test and documentation.
* Benchmark throughout the dev, qa and release cycles.
* If performance problems are observed, profile your code to see what functions to focus on.
* The tools can interfere with each other. For example, precise memory profiling skews CPU profiles, goroutine blocking profiling affects scheduler trace, etc. Rerun tests for each needed profiling mode.

## Code Review

The sample program implements support for accessing a MongoDB database from MongoLab. The program implements two different find calls that return documents that are unmarshaled into user defined types.

### Sample App

[example1.go](example1/example1.go)

[buoy/buoy.go](example1/buoy/buoy.go)

[mongodb/mongodb.go](example1/mongodb/mongodb.go)

### Tests

[Standard Tests](example1/tests/example1_test.go)

[Table Tests](example1/tests/example1_table_test.go)

[Example Tests](example1/tests/example1_example_test.go)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Write three benchmark tests for converting an integer into a string. First use the fmt.Sprintf function, then the strconv.FormatInt function and finally the strconv.Itoa. Identify which function performs the best.
